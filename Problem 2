Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix array is shown below:
const arr = [

[1, 2, 3],

[4, 5, 6],

[9, 8, 9]

]

The left-to-right diagonal = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. The right to left diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17. Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.

Goal: Your task is to create a function diagonalDifference. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.

Answer:

//Here is the required function or solution in Java

public class GFG { 
	
	public static int diagonalDifference(int arr[][], int n) 
	{ 
		// Initialize sums of diagonals 
		int d1 = 0, d2 = 0; 
	
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
		{ 
			for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) 
			{ 
				// finding sum of primary diagonal 
				if (i == j) 
					d1 += arr[i][j]; 
	
				// finding sum of secondary diagonal 
				if (i == n - j - 1) 
					d2 += arr[i][j]; 
			} 
		} 
	
		// Absolute difference of the sums 
		// across the diagonals 
		return Math.abs(d1 - d2); 
	}
